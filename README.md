## What I'm Working On

Currently building **CForge** — a SaaS platform that aggregates competitive programming data from LeetCode, Codeforces, and GitHub, serving 200+ active users with real-time analytics and spaced-repetition workflows.

Previously interned at **Credence Marketings**, where I built real-time room availability systems and RESTful APIs serving multiple clients.
